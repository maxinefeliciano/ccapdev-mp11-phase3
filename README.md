## **Instructions**
To set-up and to run the application locally through a Node.js server.  
<br />

1. Open command prompt and set the path to where the project folder is located. Once done, the command prompt should be in the following current directory:
    ```
    D:\...\CCAPDEV-Phase2-S11-Group11>
    ```
<br />

2. Initialize the Node-based project and create a package. json file by typing the following in the command prompt:
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
<br />


3. Install the following npm packages in the command prompt:
    * express
    * express-fileupload
    * body-parser
    * ejs
    * mongodb
    * mongoose
    * nodemon  _(if you have not installed it yet)_
    
    ```
    npm install <npm-package>
    ```
<br />


4.  In the command prompt, type `nodemon server.js` and press ENTER to run the application through a Node.js server.
    ```
     D:\...\CCAPDEV-Phase2-S11-Group11> nodemon server.js
    ```

    You should be able to see a console log stating that the "Server start at port 3000".

<br />


5. Open your browser and type in the adress bar `localhost:3000`. The node application should be running where it will redirect you to the
